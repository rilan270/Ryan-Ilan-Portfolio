- Note Taking Software
  - For my Intro to Software Engineering course, I worked in a team of 4 building a note taking software.
  - The software was called "CuteNote" and it was an offline notebook style application.
  - Customizable background colors, fonts, font color, font size and stickers.
  - My contribution to the software was the settings page which let the user customize the theme of the application to their preferences.
  - I also ran the test cases to ensure the software met our requirements.
  - We used agile development method, github for version control, and other software engineering techniques learned in the course.
