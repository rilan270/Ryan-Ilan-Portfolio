# Ryan-Ilan-Portfolio
Hi, I am Ryan Ilan. 
I am a Bachelor of Science student at CSUN with a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Data Science. 
I have a passion for sports and data analytics.
Current GPA at CSUN: 3.85

# Experience
- I am currently working with the CSUN baseball team as a data analytics intern.
- I have applied what I have learned in school to personal projects as well.

# Projects
- Pitcher Profiles
  - Using python, I helped review code that created reports from data collected by Trackman system at CSUN.

- Hitter Reports
  - Using python, I created a script that takes data collected by Trackman systems and creates a PDF report of a hitter's season.
  - I used the data from the CSUN Baseball Fall scrimmages to generate my first reports.
  - My reports feature the following:
    - Launch Angle and Average Exit Velocity Visual.
    - Color coded spray chart of batter's hits overlayed onto a field with CSUN's logo and dimensions.
    - 3 Metrics tables each with Totals and split to show stats VS. either handed pitcher
      - Standard Metrics (AVG, OBP, SLG, OPS, Hits, PA)
      - Approach Metrics (Swing Rate, Contact Rate, In vs Out of zone, K%, BB%)
      - Contact Quality Metrics (AVG EV, Launch Angle, Hard Hit Rate, etc.)
    - Strike zone showcasing batters swing and whiff rates in divided parts of the zone.
    - A second page or "back side" to the report splitting the 3 tables and their respective stats by pitch type instead of pitcher handedness.

- Note Taking Software
  - For my Intro to Software Engineering course, I worked in a team of 4 building a note taking software.
  - The software was called "CuteNote" and it was an offline notebook style application.
  - Customizable background colors, fonts, font color, font size and stickers.
  - My contribution to the software was the settings page which let the user customize the theme of the application to their preferences.
  - I also ran the test cases to ensure the software met our requirements.
  - We used agile development method, github for version control, and other software engineering techniques learned in the course.
